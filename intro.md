My name is Carlo Rizzo, I majored in Applied Computing for undergrad at SUNY Poly; this involved me taking many computer courses including classes about hardware and software. I am very familiar with Java, Python, C and C++. One of my favorite projects I’m very proud of was a simulation of memory allocations. There were 3 channels each with their own timer and once one job was finished, another job was loaded in. 
I am very excited to be in the course to be honest. I’ve never done anything with web programming but I understand how powerful of a skill to have and how much money can be made by doing it. Also, as I said in class, lifting weights is one of my favorite things to do, and I use an app called MyFitnessPal to track my calories and exercise for the day already. I believe this will give me an edge and inspiration to make my project stand out.
